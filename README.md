# BIP47_BDK

This code allows for the creation and manipulation of different data structures and functionality related to Bitcoin transactions and addresses.

Here is a more detailed description of each functionality:

Private and public key generation: the code uses the Bitcoin Development Kit (bdk) library to generate two new private and public keys using the PrivateKey::new() function and the PublicKey::from_private() method.

Payment code generation: the code uses the Bilateral Payment Channels (bip47) library to generate two new payment codes from the previously generated public keys using the PaymentCode::from_public_key() function.

Shared secret creation: the code uses the bip47 library to exchange the payment codes and create a shared secret using the SharedSecret::new() function.

Channel identifier creation: the code uses the bip47 library to generate a new channel identifier from the previously created shared secret using the ChannelId::from_shared_secret() function.

Bitcoin address generation: the code uses the bdk library to generate two Bitcoin addresses from the previously generated public keys using the Address::p2pkh() function.

Transaction creation: the code uses the bdk library to create a new Bitcoin transaction with one input and one output. The output is a two-key multisig output created using the Address::script_multisig() function. The input is created by spending the previously created output and using the PrivateKey::sign_multisig() method to sign the transaction with the first private key.
